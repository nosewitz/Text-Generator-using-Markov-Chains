# Text-Generator-using-Markov-Chains
Implemented a text generator that utilizes an underlying markov chain to generate text, based on inputted text and a K to determine size of k-grams.

For the GUI, in the first field place a large amount of text for best results. In the second field, a high K will mostly resemble your original text while a small K will be more random and fun. In the third field, you can input a starting string (but it must be of length K) to start off the generation.
